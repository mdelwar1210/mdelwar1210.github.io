                    <p> <b>Project Overview:</b>
                        Wellverse is a mobile application that aims to revolutionize the way users engage with their smartwatches and fitness trackers. By combining immersive experiences, personalized routines, and community engagement, WellVerse empowers individuals to maintain their health and fitness goals, promoting continuous engagement and habit-building.</p>

                    <p> <b>Prompt:</b>
                        How might we intentionally create a better world through the metaverse?</p>   
                    <br>
                    <p> <b>Problem Statement:</b>
                        1/3 of smartwatch and fitness tracker users lose interest within the first six months, resulting in a breakdown of established fitness habits. Wellverse seeks to address this issue by creating a compelling and personalized health and fitness experience within the metaverse, aimed at reengaging users and fostering long-term engagement with their health and fitness goals.</p>

                <h2>Empathize</h2>
                <br>
                <p>We initiated our research process by exploring overarching problem spaces and breaking them down into smaller, more specific problems that we could tackle through research and discussion. Some of the problem spaces we explored included the following:</p> 
                <br>
                <ul style="list-style: square; padding-left: 50px;">
                    <li>Mental Health</li>
                    <li>Gaming</li>
                    <li>Housing</li>
                    <li>Traveling</li>
                    <li>Fitness</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>After researching each of these problem spaces, we made the decision to focus on the Fitness category and continued to further research common problems that occurred under the umbrella of Fitness and Technology. We created user personas to attempt to holistically understand the key groups that face problems and what those problems were. </p>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/work files/UX:UI/WellVerse/userpersonas.png" width="80%" style="margin: auto;">
                <br>
                <p>Based on these user personas, we concluded that the design of WellVerse should aim to be fun and offer stress relief, encourage users to connect with their physical health, and provide a platform to build community within the fitness world. This insight guided our subsequent design decisions, ensuring that WellVerse was tailored to meet the specific needs and preferences of our target audience.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Research Process</b></p>
                <p>Through extensive research, we delved into the behavior of smartwatch and fitness tracker users, their interests, and habits. Additionally, we explored the possibilities of the metaverse as a portal to immerse users in their health journey. The research provided valuable insights on user disengagement, the desire for immersive experiences, and the potential to leverage data from wearables. These findings informed the development of Wellverse, ensuring a user-centered design that addresses user needs and enhances engagement in the health and fitness realm.</p>

                <h2>Define</h2>
                <br>
                <p>After getting more context on the users and the problem, it was now time to specifically define what problem we were trying to solve and who we were trying to solve it for. During this stage, we analyzed our research, defined our customer and user group, and honed in on a clear problem statement.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Target Audience</b></p>
                <p>Our target audience comprises <b>Generation Z/Young Adults and fitness tracker users</b>. We chose these groups based on their relevance to the problem we identified and their potential to benefit from the solutions offered by Wellverse.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Some questions we asked to aid in creating our problem statement:</p>
                <br>
                <ul style="list-style: square; padding-left: 50px;">
                    <li>How might we use the metaverse to benefit in areas of mindfulness, mental health, and/or fitness?</li>
                    <li>How can we use the metaverse to track and improve the physical and mental health of young adults? </li>
                    <li>How might we use the metaverse to create communities amongst users who want to increase awareness with their health?</li>
                    <li>How might we use the metaverse to promote continuous health awareness in individuals who want to track their health?</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>After analyzing our research, we created an affinity map to help identify themes in overlapping ideas of fitness and the metaverse.</p>

                <p><b>Design Process</b></p>
                <p>The design process for Wellverse involved thorough research, planning, and iterative development to ensure a user-centered and visually appealing experience. Key steps in the process included:</p>
                <br>
                <ul style="list-style: square; padding-left: 50px;">
                    <li>Thorough research to understand user needs and preferences.</li>
                    <li>Planning to establish project goals and objectives </li>
                    <li>Iterative development to refine the design based on user feedback.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Wireframing techniques were utilized to create a structured blueprint and a user flow diagram was created, guiding the layout and navigation design. User feedback and usability testing played a crucial role in iterating and refining the app's design.</p>

                <p>Wellverse incorporates visually appealing and intuitive design elements. The app features eye-catching images and an intuitive interface that facilitates easy access and seamless navigation. The color scheme and typography are carefully selected to enhance readability, user engagement, and a sense of harmony within the app's visual aesthetics.</p>
