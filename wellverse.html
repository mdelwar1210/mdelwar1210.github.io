Additionally, we explored the possibilities of the metaverse as a portal to immerse users in their health journey. The research provided valuable insights on user disengagement, the desire for immersive experiences, and the potential to leverage data from wearables. These findings informed the development of Wellverse, ensuring a user-centered design that addresses user needs and enhances engagement in the health and fitness realm.</p>
